## Do you have the GUTS Hackathon 2022

### Hackathon Project (GUITARGUITAR): 

Create an innovative store viewer/page. Take the data (provided by the company), explore it, and devise a creative way to view, filter, navigate, slide or even play through!

### Idea:

The idea revolves around the UI/UX of the website and is inspired by the Zara and Netflix website. We've picked a few elements from both Zara and Netflix. 

**First Page/Front Page:** Our first page of the website will look a lot like Zara's current UI, where swiping vertically, the website will show different companies' guitars (Gibson, Epiphone, Yamaha, etc.). Swiping (left or right) horizontally shows different guitars (Acoustic, Electric, and Bass). 

The first page won't include any filters as a visitor coming to an online e-commerce platform expects to find different types and brands of guitars. They don't need checkboxes at that moment. So, the first page will be reserved for special deals and show them the store's inventory.

**Second Page/Full Inventory:** Once a person clicks on a type or a brand of the Guitar, they'll be taken to the second page, which will show them all of the guitars of the respective brand/type or all of the guitars together. The filter's location will be horizontal, like Airbnb, as all the filter options will be available at once. All of the filters will have interactive filtering.

**Third Window:** When a person clicks on Guitar, a display window appears like a Netflix series description window. At this window, the person can closely look at the Guitar with its description and the songs allocated to the particular Guitar so that they can listen to the tone of the Guitar and the songs that sound good with the particular Guitar.

**Fourth Feature:** We've built an Artificial Intelligent ChatBot using IBM Watson Assistant and integrated it with the website. We have included the ChatBot as it will make the user's experience on the website better and easier.
